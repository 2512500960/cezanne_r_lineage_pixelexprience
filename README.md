experimental, every piece of code is copied
device tree code is at gitee : https://gitee.com/erlkonig/android_device_xiaomi_cezanne.git
kernel code is at gitee : https://gitee.com/erlkonig/xiaomi_kernel_cezanne_r_oss.git
prebuilt kernel along with the kernel modules are in <device_tree>/prebuilt/11, since vermagic of kernel and kernel modules need to be the same
